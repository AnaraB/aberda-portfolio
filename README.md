# React + Vite

This is my personal portfolio showcasing the projects I've built as a web developer. The portfolio is fully responsive and built using React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and React Hook Form. It highlights my skills in front-end development using the React framework but also displays my other portfolios where I showcase my full-stack development skills, including API integration, authentication, and data visualisation.
